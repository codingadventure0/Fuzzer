# Web Application Fuzzer Tool

## üöÄ Project Overview

This is a **Comprehensive Web Application Fuzzer** developed as part of **Smart India Hackathon 2024 (SIH)**. The project addresses the **SIH Problem Statement ID: SIH1750** under the **Miscellaneous Theme**. Our tool aims to automate web application security testing by integrating popular tools such as OWASP ZAP, Sqlmap, Nmap, and others, providing a unified GUI interface for developers and security teams.

> **Team Name:** AlgoOptimizers  
> **Team ID:** 15285  

## üéØ Problem Statement

The goal was to create a cross-platform **Web Application Fuzzer** that detects vulnerabilities in web applications, APIs, and networks, while offering features like:
- **Subdomain Enumeration**
- **Vulnerability Detection**
- **Dependency Testing**
- **Unified Reporting**

This tool enables **early vulnerability detection**, strengthens DevSecOps pipelines, and ensures compliance with standards like OWASP, GDPR, and HIPAA.

## üõ†Ô∏è Features

1. **Modular Architecture:**  
   Integrates multiple open-source tools for comprehensive security testing:
   - **Subdomain Enumeration:** OWASP Amass
   - **Vulnerability Scanning:** OWASP ZAP, OpenVAS, Arachni
   - **SQL Injection Detection:** Sqlmap
   - **Fuzzing:** Wfuzz
   - **Network Scanning:** Nmap
   - **Dependency Scanning:** Snyk
   - **API Testing:** Postman
   - **Exploit Testing:** Metasploit
   - **Web App Testing:** OWASP Juice Shop

2. **Cross-Platform Compatibility:**  
   Runs on **Linux**, **macOS**, and **Windows**.

3. **Graphical User Interface (GUI):**  
   Developed using `Tkinter` for easy interaction.

4. **Unified Reporting:**  
   Saves scan results as **JSON reports** for easy sharing and actionable insights.

5. **Customizability:**  
   The modular architecture allows easy addition or removal of tools.

6. **Compliance:**  
   Supports OWASP Top 10, GDPR, and HIPAA compliance testing.

## üìã Current Limitations and Known Issues

1. **Dependency Assumptions:**
   - All external tools must be pre-installed and configured correctly.
   - Missing tools or misconfigurations result in failures during scans.

2. **Incomplete Commands:**
   - Some commands (e.g., `arachni --scan target`) are placeholders and need refinement for production use.

3. **Simplistic Vulnerability Marking:**
   - Relies on keyword detection (e.g., "vulnerable" or "vulnerability") in tool outputs, which may lead to false positives or missed vulnerabilities.

4. **Wordlist Dependency:**
   - Fuzzing (`Wfuzz`) requires a `wordlist.txt` file, which is not included in the project.

5. **Limited Validation:**
   - No validation of target URLs before initiating scans.

6. **Performance Overhead:**
   - Scanning large applications may cause delays, especially when multiple tools are selected.
